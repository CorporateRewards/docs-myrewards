# SSO (Single Sign On)

The MyRewards platform supports Single Sign On (SSO) through SAML and OIDC protocols. This allows users to authenticate using their existing credentials from an identity provider, streamlining the login process and enhancing security.

## Limitations and Declarations
- Single Sign On (SSO) experience is only available for end-users; backend administrators are authenticated via dedicated credentials.
- Only one SSO provider can be configured per programme / site.
